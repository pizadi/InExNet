# InExNet
A convolutional feature extraction model, which relies on an inhibition-excitation connections to facilitate the training process.

This design uses features from well-known ConvNet architectures such as MobileNet, InceptionNet, and ResNet. The addition of an inhibition-excitation block aims to connect globally-oriented features and locally-oriented ones, without concatenating them, and by using a smaller number of parameters.
